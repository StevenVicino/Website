        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I recieved my bachelor's in Creative Writing and Business Management
          from Empire State College. I have over a decade of management
          experience having worked for Michael's Arts and Crafts and Bimbo
          Bakeries USA. While I enjoyed management I went through an intensive
          software engineering bootcamp at Thinkful, in order to follow my
          passion for web development. I am interested in joining the industry
          and working with other people who share my passion for coding.

          <h3>Restaurant Reservation App</h3>
          <p>
            This application is used by the restaurant staff. When a customer
            calls, the employee can record their information, search by phone
            number or date, can seat them at a table when they arrive and free
            the table when the party leaves. The app implements react router and
            express to build a RESTful API in order to make HTTP requests for
            all of the reservation data stored on the connected PostgreSQL
            database. It also utilizes CRUD functions and knex queries to handle
            data going to and coming from the database.
          </p>
          <p>Technology Used: React, Node.js, Express, Knex and PostgreSQL.</p>
